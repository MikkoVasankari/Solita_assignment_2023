# Solita_assingment_2023
This is my solution to the solita [dev-academy-2023 pre-assignment](https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2023-exercise). 
In this assignment I have used docker to run the backend side of the code.

### To Install the project
You should be able just to clone the project from GitHub with command
```git clone https://github.com/MikkoVasankari/Solita_assingment_2023.git ```



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
